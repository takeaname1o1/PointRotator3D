To visualize the topic **"Rotation of a Point about an Arbitrary Axis in 3D Space"** online, you can use interactive tools or libraries that allow you to simulate 3D transformations. Since I can't directly embed visualizations here, I'll guide you on how to achieve this using freely available online tools and provide a conceptual description of what to expect. Below are some options and steps to visualize the matrix and quaternion methods described earlier.

---

### Option 1: Using Online 3D Visualization Tools
#### Tool: GeoGebra 3D Calculator
- **Website**: [GeoGebra 3D Calculator](https://www.geogebra.org/3d)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Set Up the Scene**:
     - Open GeoGebra 3D Calculator.
     - Plot the point \( P = (x, y, z) \) (e.g., \( (1, 1, 1) \)) using the "Point" tool.
     - Define the rotation axis by plotting two points, \( P_1 = (x_1, y_1, z_1) \) and \( P_2 = (x_2, y_2, z_2) \) (e.g., \( (0, 0, 0) \) and \( (1, 0, 0) \)), and draw a line between them using the "Line" tool.
  2. **Matrix Transformation Visualization**:
     - Manually input the transformation matrices (\( T, R_x, R_y, R_z \)) step-by-step using the "Matrix" input option.
     - Apply each matrix to \( P \) and plot the intermediate points after each step (e.g., after translation, after \( R_x \), etc.).
     - Use the "Rotate" tool to simulate the \( R_z \) rotation by \( \theta \) (e.g., \( 90^\circ \)).
     - Reverse the steps using inverse matrices to see the full process.
  3. **Quaternion Visualization**:
     - GeoGebra doesn’t natively support quaternions, but you can compute the rotated point offline (using the quaternion formulas) and input the result to visualize the final position.
  4. **Observation**:
     - Watch how the point moves in 3D space step-by-step, aligning with the axis and rotating around it.

#### What You’ll See:
- A 3D grid with axes (X, Y, Z).
- The original point \( P \) as a dot.
- The rotation axis as a line.
- The transformed point \( P' \) after applying the matrices or quaternion.

### Option 2: Using WebGL/JavaScript (Three.js)
#### Tool: Three.js Online Editor
- **Website**: [Three.js Editor](https://threejs.org/editor/)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Set Up the Scene**:
     - Open the Three.js Editor.
     - Add a sphere to represent the point \( P \) (e.g., at \( (1, 1, 1) \)).
     - Add a line to represent the rotation axis (e.g., from \( (0, 0, 0) \) to \( (1, 0, 0) \)).
  2. **Matrix Method**:
     - Use the JavaScript console to define the transformation matrices (\( T, R_x, R_y, R_z \)) as arrays.
     - Apply each matrix sequentially to the sphere’s position using the `matrix.multiply()` function.
     - Animate the steps to see the translation, rotations, and reversal.
  3. **Quaternion Method**:
     - Three.js natively supports quaternions! Define the quaternion \( Q_2 = (\cos(\theta/2), r_x \sin(\theta/2), r_y \sin(\theta/2), r_z \sin(\theta/2)) \) using `THREE.Quaternion`.
     - Apply it to the sphere’s position with `sphere.quaternion.set()` and update the scene.
  4. **Observation**:
     - Real-time rotation of the sphere around the custom axis with smooth animation.

#### What You’ll See:
- A 3D scene with a sphere (point \( P \)) and a line (axis).
- The sphere moving to the origin, aligning with the Z-axis, rotating by \( \theta \), and returning to its final position (Matrix Method).
- A direct, smooth rotation for the Quaternion Method.

### Option 3: Python with Matplotlib (Offline but Visualizable Online)
#### Tool: Google Colab
- **Website**: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Code Setup**:
     - Create a new Colab notebook.
     - Install Matplotlib: `!pip install matplotlib`.
     - Use the following code to visualize:
       ```python
       import numpy as np
       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
       from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

       # Define point and axis
       P = np.array([1, 1, 1])  # Point to rotate
       P1, P2 = np.array([0, 0, 0]), np.array([1, 0, 0])  # Axis
       theta = np.pi / 2  # 90 degrees

       # Translation matrix
       T = np.array([[1, 0, 0, -P1[0]], [0, 1, 0, -P1[1]], [0, 0, 1, -P1[2]], [0, 0, 0, 1]])

       # Simplified rotation (assuming axis is X for demo)
       Rz = np.array([[np.cos(theta), np.sin(theta), 0, 0], 
                      [-np.sin(theta), np.cos(theta), 0, 0], 
                      [0, 0, 1, 0], 
                      [0, 0, 0, 1]])
       T_inv = np.array([[1, 0, 0, P1[0]], [0, 1, 0, P1[1]], [0, 0, 1, P1[2]], [0, 0, 0, 1]])

       # Apply transformation
       P_h = np.append(P, 1)  # Homogeneous coordinates
       P_new = T_inv @ Rz @ T @ P_h

       # Plot
       fig = plt.figure()
       ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
       ax.scatter(P[0], P[1], P[2], color='blue', label='Original')
       ax.scatter(P_new[0], P_new[1], P_new[2], color='red', label='Rotated')
       ax.plot([P1[0], P2[0]], [P1[1], P2[1]], [P1[2], P2[2]], color='green', label='Axis')
       ax.legend()
       plt.show()
       ```
  2. **Run and Visualize**:
     - Execute the code to see a 3D plot of the original point, rotated point, and axis.
     - Modify \( P, P_1, P_2, \theta \) to experiment with different scenarios.

#### What You’ll See:
- A static 3D plot with:
  - Blue dot: Original point \( P \).
  - Red dot: Rotated point \( P' \).
  - Green line: Rotation axis.

### Conceptual Visualization Description
Imagine a 3D coordinate system:
1. **Matrix Method**:
   - Start: A point \( P \) (e.g., a blue sphere) floats in space, with a green line (axis) from \( P_1 \) to \( P_2 \).
   - Step 1: The entire scene shifts so \( P_1 \) is at the origin.
   - Step 2: The axis tilts into the XZ-plane (watch YZ components adjust).
   - Step 3: The axis aligns with the Z-axis.
   - Step 4: \( P \) orbits around the Z-axis by \( \theta \) (e.g., a circular path).
   - Steps 5-7: The scene reverses, placing \( P \) in its final rotated position.

2. **Quaternion Method**:
   - Start: Same setup (blue sphere, green axis).
   - Action: The sphere smoothly rotates around the axis in one fluid motion, landing at \( P' \) (red sphere).

### Recommendation
- For **quick visualization**: Use GeoGebra (beginner-friendly).
- For **interactive coding**: Use Three.js (great for understanding implementation).
- For **exam prep**: Use Colab to compute and plot specific examples from your notes.
